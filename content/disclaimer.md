Not all COVID-19 tests are the same! Most common tests are around 50% accurate with low viral loads where the person does not exhibit any symptoms.

The most important column is CT 25-30, the sensitivity with a relatively low viral load.

Listing/searching COVID tests and their sensitivities based on the preprint of the [research article](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.11.21257016) by Scheiblauer et al. 2021. Please note that this has not been peer reviewed and should not be used to guide clinical practice.
