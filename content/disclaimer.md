Not all SARS-CoV-19 (COVID-19 Virus) tests are the same! Most common tests are around 50% accurate with low viral loads where the person does not exhibit any symptoms.

The most important column is CT 25-30, which corresponds to sensitivity of the tests with a low viral load. Anything above CT 30 is not deemed realiable therefore not that important. CT stands for [Cycle Threshold](https://fullfact.org/health/cycle-threshold-values/). Basically it is the number of cycles before a sequence of genes in a PCR test is observed. Lower the number, fewer cycles needed to detect the virus, hence a higher viral load. The test and manufacturer names are colored based on this column.

**Listing/searching COVID tests and their sensitivities based on the preprint of the [research article](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.11.21257016) by Scheiblauer et al. 2021. Please note that this has not been peer reviewed and should not be used to guide clinical practice.**
